# Notation3 by example

This repository contains a growing collection of examples how to use
[Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/) [built-ins](https://w3c.github.io/N3/files/builtin_spec.html).

The Notation3 built-ins are still a part of current specification development. Don't assume that all examples will be part of the official spec. Check the Notation3 specification for the official list and interpratation of the built-ins.

## Install

Most of the examples should work with the [EYE](https://github.com/josd/eye) reasoner.

See (CWM)[https://github.com/sbp/cwm] and (jen3)[https://github.com/william-vw/jen3] for alternative implemenatations.
