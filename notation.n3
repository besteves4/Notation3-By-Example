# The equal sign is used to express an owl:sameAs identity.
# This means the subject and object IRI refer to the same
# thing. This does NOT mean that the subject and object IRI 
# are equal. This also does NOT mean that any inferences
# you make about the subject are also valid for the object.
#
# This will not work:
#
#      :Alice :knows :Bob .
#      :Alice = <http://alice.pods.me/profile/card#me> .
#      {
#         ?A :knows ?B .
#      }
#      => 
#      {
#         ?B :knows ?A ,
#      } .  
#
# and expecting as answer:
#
#      <http://alice.pods.me/profile/card#me> :knows :Bob.
:Alice :knows :Bob .
